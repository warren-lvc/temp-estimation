🏛️ Overview

This project presents a low-cost, contactless system for ambient temperature estimation developed at CSIR-NPL, New Delhi, under Prof. P.K. Dubey.

The system measures ultrasonic time-of-flight (TOF) with an HC-SR04 sensor and an ATmega16A microcontroller, calculates the ultrasonic propagation velocity in air, and estimates temperature with high precision (±0.4 °C). Results are displayed in real-time via a 16x2 LCD, demonstrating repeatable and reliable measurements suitable for laboratory and industrial applications.

🔬 Methodology

Ultrasonic Pulse Emission: HC-SR04 emits a 10 µs pulse toward a fixed 100 cm reflector.

Time-of-Flight Measurement: ATmega16A measures round-trip time digitally.

Velocity Calculation:

       c = 2d / t ​

where 
c is the velocity of sound in air in m/s

d = reflector distance in m, 

t = TOF in sec

Temperature Estimation:

        c = 331.4 + 0.606 T

where 
where, c is the velocity of sound in air in m/s, 331.4 m/s is the velocity of sound at 0°C, 0.606 is the temperature coefficient, indicating how sound speed increases per degree rise in temperature, T is the ambient temperature in °C.

Signal Processing:
    1. 200-sample averaging to reduce random jitter

    2. 10 ms inter-sample delay to prevent residual echo interference

Display: Real-time temperature output on 16x2 LCD.

📈 Key Results
